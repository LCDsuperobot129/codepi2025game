README FILE

This repository is for my Roblox STEM game made for CodePi 2025. Created by ckev78 (LCDsuperobot129) and GoatedOnWLR.
Programming language is Lua.
Some aspects and files will only be functional on Roblox Studio, as it has special functions and objects.

Roblox Game Link: https://www.roblox.com/games/91100180965981/Xscape -- COPY AND PASTE THIS INTO YOUR BROWSER'S SEARCH BAR; YOU MUST HAVE ROBLOX DOWNLOADED AND HAVE A ROBLOX ACCOUNT TO PLAY THIS ROBLOX GAME!

-- File Inspecting
TO DO THE FOLLOWING, YOU MUST DOWNLOAD ROBLOX STUDIO AND HAVE A ROBLOX ACCOUNT (Download Roblox as well if you want to play Xscape, our Roblox game.)

If you want to open a .rbxm file, you have to download the .rbxm file, load Roblox Studio, go to Workspace, right click, select insert from file, and import the .rbxm file you want.

The viewable scripts are in the programming language Lua, but they are not .lua files. Copy and paste the script(s)'s code into a script in Roblox Studio.
Some code may be in a script, localscript, and in different parents. So, it may not work if it is not the correct type of script or the wrong parent.

Also, some indentations and spaces are increased on Github for some reason, and it may look weird. Please ignore.

-- Github Repo Folders
Folders have names that are directly attributed to the built-in services and folders in Roblox Studio by default.
